# Things to Fix & Observations
## 6/6/24, Johnny
### Mod: J Notes
- Space 220 Kids lunch and dinner beverages price is listed at 220
- If Row J contains both 'Glass' and 'Bottle' price options, can we create 1 row for each; dupliate row, add ", Glass" to row A of first, ", Bottle" to row A of second, then put the price of each in Row B
- Splitsville 'Top it off' add ons took the wrong number, the Grain 153 and listed that as price
- The descriptions, Row J, that have multiple numbers are really messing with this a lot, can we just create duplicate rows for each, put the price in Row B, append the text to Row A and see how that complicates things? Some will be worse, but most may be better; will be tricky when they have numbers as part of description, e.g. 1/2-oz 90.50
- Space 220 8oz filet will cause issues with above suggestion
- California Grill, row A has price, but it pulls it from row J; it is correct, but would like to change row A name to "Adult Meal" or something after price is pulled
- The Fountain, row A has Small/Large Prices, again duplicating and splitting would be great way to make it work
- 4 Rivers Cantina Barbacoa Food Truck, Tri-Tip Steak has price changed to its add-on?

### Mod: D Notes
- No solution for price rangges, they suck
- Need solution for Prix Fixe/Dining Packages that put each element of meal in row D, then get their own price, e.g. search for the Cirque Du Soleil Dining Package; would be great to combine them into one single package row
- Garden Grill, lunch/dinner, Chip N Dale Harvest Feast has both kid and adult prices in row D; also has each menu item per row; can we find way to assemble names into description and create "adult meal" and "child meal" rows

### Mod: A Notes
- Looks the best overall
- Biggest fix is removing the price after it is put in row B and updating Name to match the meal
- Again, no ideas for price ranges, so no worries there
- A few rows; Via Napoli, The Fountain, etc; have multiple prices, but not ranges, would be great to split those if possible;
